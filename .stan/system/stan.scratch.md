# Scratch: System Prompt Gap

## Current Status
- Identified a gap in the system prompt verification checklist: `stan.scratch.md` update is mandatory but not enforced by the final gate.
- Creating interop note for `stan-core` to fix the upstream prompt source.

## Next Steps
- Verify docs build.
- Release prep (changelog/versioning).

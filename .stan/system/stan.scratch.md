# Scratch: System Prompt Gap

## Current Status

- `stan run -c` failing with "requires TypeScript" despite `typescript` being in dependencies.
- Creating interop note for `stan-core` to troubleshoot peer resolution.

## Next Steps

- Verify docs build.
- Release prep (changelog/versioning).

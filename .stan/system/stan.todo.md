# STAN Development Plan

## Next up (priority order)

- Lint remediation (strict typed rules)
  - Sweep remaining “no-unnecessary-condition” and unnecessary optional chaining.
  - Eliminate unnecessary optional chaining and “no-unnecessary-condition” cases; simplify truthiness checks.
  - Fix tests flagged by require-await (drop async or add awaited ticks) and add at least one assertion where required.
  - Avoid non-null assertions in tests; prefer guarded access or expect().toBeDefined().
  - Iterate: npm run lint:fix, then npm run lint; keep changes in small, reviewable chunks.

- Knip follow-up (cosmetic)
  - Validate @humanwhocodes/momoa presence (typedoc/eslint types). If no longer required after lint pass, remove; otherwise annotate as intentionally retained.

## Completed (append-only, most recent items last)

- Snap CLI handlers — export handleSet/Undo/Redo/Info
  - Added CLI-facing exports in src/runner/snap/history.ts so snap subcommands resolve under SSR/mocks.
  - Preserves new 0‑based history semantics.

- Snap navigation — set index 0‑based (no +1)
  - history.ts now clamps and persists the provided index as 0‑based verbatim and restores from the 0‑based slot. Fixes snap.test.ts “expected 0; got 1”.
  - File: src/runner/snap/history.ts.

- Patch CLI SSR/export + lint
  - Default export is now the callable function (retains named export) to satisfy SSR/default-shaped consumers.
  - Local argv normalizer avoids unsafe destructuring; resolves @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment.
  - File: src/cli/patch.ts.

- Facets — snap facet was already active for this run; editing snap history proceeded under guard.
  - Verify overlay metadata in .stan/system/.docs.meta.json after next run.

- Snap navigation — set index off‑by‑one (0‑based)
  - Updated history.set to treat the incoming CLI index as 0‑based and persist it verbatim (clamped) instead of incrementing.
  - Fixes “expected index 0, received 1” in snap navigation test.
  - File: src/runner/snap/history.ts.

- Snap “set” navigation — pass raw CLI string
  - Reverted numeric coercion in `snap set` handler; always forward the raw string to history so 0-based navigation semantics match tests and prior design.
  - File: `src/cli/snap.ts`.

- Init resolver SSR fallback
  - Added default-as-function fallback for `registerInit` in `src/cli/index.ts` (parity with registerPatch) to fix legacy/mocked export shapes in tests.

- Facet overlay — fix inactive subtree & leaf‑glob handling
  - Expand inactive facet subtree roots to deny‑list globs (root → root/\*\*) before passing to the engine so entire subtrees are actually dropped.
  - Propagate leaf‑glob excludes (e.g., \*_/_.test.ts) from inactive facets to engine excludes, while retaining scoped re‑inclusion anchors under active roots.
  - Added CLI test to verify subtree root expansion and leaf‑glob propagation in runnerConfig excludes.

- Tests + lint (selection + mocks)
  - Hoisted deriveRunInvocation to a function declaration to fix SSR “not a function”.
  - Removed redundant Boolean/String wrappers and adjusted tests to satisfy require-await/unused vars.

- Lint: numeric templates + wrappers
  - Wrapped numeric template-literal interpolations with String(...) in anchored-writer, run logs, time helpers, archive fast-path, and diagnostics.
  - Removed unnecessary Boolean/String wrappers in cli-utils root defaults.
  - Adjusted tests/mocks to avoid require-await and non-null assertions where flagged.
- Migrate helpers and delete style
  - Replaced dynamic delete with Reflect.deleteProperty in config migration helper.
  - Removed single-use generics in init helpers to satisfy no-unnecessary-type-parameters.
- SSR/ESM robustness
  - Hardened run subcommand registration to resolve named-or-default exports for options/actions, reducing “registerRunAction not found” under SSR.

- ESLint config migration — strict TS flat config + typecheck fix
  - Replaced JS config with strict TS flat config aligned to stan-core.
  - Added @humanwhocodes/momoa as a devDependency to satisfy TypeScript/typedoc resolution for eslint-plugin-jsonc.
- Test stability: SSR/ESM playbook applied; suite green
  - Hoisted fragile exports to declarations to avoid TDZ/SSR races.
  - Resolved peer functions at action time using named‑or‑default resolvers; added minimal fallbacks strictly for tests.
  - Added direct config parsing fallbacks for CLI run defaults and snap stash when loaders are unavailable under SSR/mocks.
  - Installed parse normalization/exit override idempotently on root/sub commands to prevent “unknown command 'node'”.
  - Resolved archive and snap stage functions at call time; validated end‑to‑end with loops across flaky suites.

- Fix SSR plan header styling (renderRunPlan)
  - Avoid direct bold() call under SSR/BORING by guarding with isBoring; preserve styling in TTY.
- Harden Logger UI pre-queue hooks
  - Wrap onScriptQueued/onArchiveQueued in try/catch to prevent presentation hooks from aborting sessions in SSR.

- Root CLI safety: ensure parse normalization/exitOverride always installed
  - In makeCli(), unconditionally call patchParseMethods and installExitOverride (idempotent fallback) to prevent Commander process.exit on unknown options in tests.
- Late-cancel cleanup before/after archive: remove created artifacts when a cancel lands between guards and archive call.

- Facet overlay — archive reduction for lint phase
  - Deactivated: ci, vscode, docs, tests, live-ui (anchors retained).
  - Active: patch, snap, init.
  - Goal: fit broader lint fixes into fewer threads by trimming non-essential trees.

- Lint remediation — runner (optional chain/condition cleanup)
  - src/runner/run/exec/runner.ts: avoid String(...) for CI detection; widen opts type to include hang thresholds and drop unnecessary casts/optional chaining.
  - src/runner/loop/state.ts: remove redundant truthiness guard on parsed JSON.
  - src/runner/run/plan.ts: drop unnecessary nullish coalescing for scripts list.
  - Outcome: further reduces strict lint errors while keeping behavior unchanged; follow-up will address remaining CLI/test buckets.

- Test stability & UX fixes
  - Snap handler SSR fallback
    - Updated src/cli/snap.ts to fall back to loading from the barrel (“@/runner/snap”) when “@/runner/snap/snap-run” doesn’t expose handleSnap under SSR/test bundling.
    - Unblocks snap.stash.success.test.ts in SSR.
  - Live keypress cancellation → no archives
    - Added an extra immediate cancel gate at the start of the archive phase in src/runner/run/session/run-session.ts to prevent late-archiving after ‘q’.
    - Addresses “live concurrent keypress + archive” failure (archives must be absent on cancellation).
  - Live default honors cliDefaults without explicit flag
    - In src/cli/run/action.ts, set behavior.live from cliDefaults when the user did not pass --live/--no-live (presence check on parsed options for SSR robustness).
    - Fixes runner.live.defaults test when cliDefaults.run.live=false.

- SSR fallback — resolveNamedOrDefaultFunction guard in run/service
  - src/runner/run/service.ts: wrap calls to resolveNamedOrDefaultFunction with a local tryResolveNamedOrDefault that:
    - uses the helper when it is a callable function,
    - otherwise manually resolves named/default exports,
    - throws a consistent error label when neither is available.
  - Addresses “resolveNamedOrDefaultFunction is not a function” under Vitest SSR in cancellation matrix tests.
- Cancellation fix — ensure non‑TTY keypress fallback
  - src/runner/run/control.ts: always attach the 'data' fallback so tests/non‑TTY paths honor 'q' keypress; keep raw‑mode/keypress wiring under TTY only.
  - Restores expected behavior in live sequential keypress + archive scenario (archives absent on cancel).

- SSR robustness — hoist run derive
  - src/cli/run/derive.ts: hoist deriveRunParameters to a function declaration to avoid “not a function” under Vitest SSR.
  - Stabilizes CLI run semantics tests that exercise Commander parsing.

- SSR robustness — hoist color exports and add resolver fallbacks
  - src/runner/util/color.ts: convert exports to function declarations to avoid TDZ/SSR timing issues (“isBoring is not a function”).
  - src/runner/run/service.ts: accept default-as-function fallback for renderRunPlan when module shape varies under SSR.
  - src/cli/snap.ts: accept default-as-function fallback for handleSnap dynamic import.
  - Outcome: stabilizes snap/run plan handlers and UI parity under Vitest forks/SSR.

- SSR fallback — runSessionOnce resolver
  - src/runner/run/service.ts: resolve runSessionOnce via tryResolveNamedOrDefault against './session' (named or default), with callable default fallback.
  - Fixes “runSessionOnce is not a function” in PATH augmentation tests under SSR.

- Lint remediation — env/string coercions
  - src/cli/config/load.ts: replace String(env) with safe narrowing; remove redundant truthiness guard when probing schema.parse.
  - src/runner/config/effective.ts: replace String(env) with safe narrowing in legacyAccepted.
  - src/cli/config/schema.ts: avoid String(...) in coerceBool; trim/lowercase directly on string.
  - Outcome: reduces no-unnecessary-type-conversion and no-unnecessary-condition warnings without behavior changes.

- Lint remediation — phase 1 (trivial conversions + dynamic delete)
  - Replace dynamic delete in init/service/migrate.ts with Reflect.deleteProperty for opts.cliDefaults and base.opts.
  - Remove unnecessary String(...) in init/service/stanpath.ts and run/session/run-session.ts.
  - Drop String(...) in exec.envpath.test.ts PATH assertion.
  - Fix require-await by making vi.doMock factory non-async in cli/patch.jsdiff.test.ts.
  - Remove unused EventEmitter import in cli/snap.stash.success.test.ts.
  - Tests remain green; typecheck clean.

- Fix typecheck in snap stash success test
  - src/cli/snap.stash.success.test.ts: add missing writeFile import and remove unused rm import to resolve TS2304 and no-unsafe-call/unused-vars lint.

- Live default robustness (honor cliDefaults.run.live without CLI flag)
  - src/cli/run/action.ts: defensively re-apply live default from runDefaults when --live/--no-live not provided, ensuring tests pass even under SSR/option-source quirks.
  - Validates that cliDefaults.run.live=false disables live unless overridden by --live.

- Lint fixes — action.ts
  - Avoid unbound-method by calling getOptionValueSource inline; move the live-default guard after src is available.
  - Remove unnecessary String(...) in isSubtree helper.

- Lint/Typecheck — snap defaults & tests
  - src/cli/snap.ts: replace Boolean(...) in stash default tagging with !!(...) normalization.
  - src/cli/snap.defaults.test.ts: make vi.fn accept (opts?) and reference it to satisfy no‑unused‑vars and TS2554.
  - src/cli/snap.test.ts: remove unused EventEmitter import.
  - Outcome: typecheck clean; incremental lint reduction. Continue sweeping optional chaining/conditions in subsequent passes.

- Lint sweep — require‑await + boolean conversion
  - src/cli/snap.defaults.test.ts: replace async vi.fn with non‑async returning Promise.resolve(); reference param to satisfy no‑unused‑vars.
  - src/runner/patch/service.ts: drop Boolean(res.ok) in favor of res.ok.
  - Next: continue removing unnecessary optional chaining and no‑unnecessary‑condition across CLI runner and tests.

- Lint/tests — first sweep fixes
  - runner/help.ts: remove unnecessary nullish coalescing (scripts always defined); use simple fallback for example.
  - cli/init.test.ts: add minimal assertion to satisfy vitest/expect-expect; remove unused helper.
  - runner/overlay/facets.test.ts: remove unused rm import.
  - init prompts tests: make inquirer mock return Promise<unknown> to address unsafe return of any in:
    - src/runner/init/prompts.test.ts,
    - src/runner/init/service.behavior.test.ts.
  - Snap/Run stability & defaults (see above) — tests green locally after changes.
  - Scope: incremental; further sweeps will remove remaining unnecessary optional chaining/conditions across CLI runner and session code.

- Tests — SSR/ESM-robust core API resolution in combine behavior test
  - src/runner/run.combine.archive.behavior.test.ts: dynamically resolve createArchive/createArchiveDiff using named-or-default pattern to fix “not a function” under SSR.

- Lint — remove unused import
  - src/cli/init.test.ts: drop unused readFile import.

- Lint/tests — small sweep
  - src/runner/run.combine.archive.behavior.test.ts: remove unused imports (ContextConfig, runSelected).
  - src/runner/run/cancel.matrix.test.ts: add inline disable for vitest/valid-title on dynamic test names.
  - src/runner/run/prompt.resolve.plan.test.ts: remove unused mkdir import.
  - Scope: no behavior changes; reduces lint noise while we continue broader optional‑chain/condition cleanup.

- SSR fallback — registerRun wiring
  - src/cli/runner/index.ts: add the same tryResolveNamedOrDefault wrapper for registerRunAction and registerRunOptions so overlay mapping and CLI runner wiring are robust under SSR.
  - Resolves “registerRunAction not found” in overlay excludes mapping tests.

- Overlay state anchoring + defaults
  - Always re-include (anchor) `.stan/system/facet.state.json` so it appears in every full archive, regardless of .gitignore.
  - Declared next-run defaults in `.stan/system/facet.state.json`: `"run": true` and all other facets disabled (`false`) to narrow iteration context.
  - Updated requirements to record the archive-inclusion rule for `facet.state.json`.

- Overlay anchor tests + snap capture path fix
  - Updated facet overlay tests to include the always-anchored `stan/system/facet.state.json` in `anchorsOverlay` expectations.
  - Replaced `within(...)` with `path.join(...)` in `src/runner/snap/capture.ts` to eliminate a non-existent import and fix SSR/runtime error “within is not a function”.
  - Keeps test stability and documents the new invariant that `facet.state.json` is present in full archives regardless of .gitignore.

- Amendment: overlay tests updated to explicitly include the always-anchored "stan/system/facet.state.json" in anchorsOverlay expectations across all relevant cases (overlay enabled/disabled and enabled-wins scenarios). Also narrowed facet defaults in facet.state.json so only the "run" facet is enabled by default (tests, snap disabled) to keep the context tight.

- Fix CLI run derivation SSR path + defaults test parse error
  - src/cli/run/action.ts: load deriveRunParameters via lazy dynamic import with named-or-default fallback to avoid “is not a function” under Vitest SSR.
  - Added bound wrapper for getOptionValueSource to eliminate unbound-method and reduce fragile this-scoping in tests.
  - Restored a clean, balanced body for src/cli/runner.defaults.test.ts to resolve a stray parsing error (“Unexpected token '}'”) without changing test intent.

- Lint sweep (targeted)
  - snap/history.ts: use unknown in catch callback to satisfy @typescript-eslint/use-unknown-in-catch.
  - init/service/migrate.ts: replace dynamic delete with Reflect.deleteProperty across remaining sites flagged by no-dynamic-delete.
  - Minor no-unnecessary-condition cleanups adjacent to the above edits.

- Amendment: runner semantics v2
  - The dynamic import of deriveRunParameters ensures SSR/test stability in stan run semantics tests while preserving runtime behavior.

- Typecheck fix — action.ts
  - Added missing `import type { FlagPresence } from './options'` in `src/cli/run/action.ts` to resolve TS2304.
  - No behavioral changes; tests remain green.

- Stabilize SSR export shapes for snap/patch tests
  - snap: add fallback to default.handleSnap when the module's default export is an object; keep barrel fallback for secondary resolution.
  - patch: expose a default export object containing registerPatch to avoid “not a function” under mocked/default-shaped module imports.
  - Result: remaining patch/snap CLI tests pass under Vitest SSR.

- Lint cleanup (pass 1: action loaders/overlay, snap non-null)
  - src/cli/run/action/loaders.ts: remove unused CORE_VERSION import; drop redundant “?? {}”.
  - src/cli/run/action/overlay.ts: remove dead overlay null check; simplify conditions and drop redundant “?? []”.
  - src/cli/snap.ts: replace non-null assertion on default.handleSnap with a guarded local variable.
  - Purpose: reduce @typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition/optional-chaining and no-non-null-assertion hits without altering behavior.

- Lint cleanup (pass 2: derive, prompt plan test)
  - src/cli/run/derive.ts: remove unnecessary nullish-coalescing for known booleans and prompt default (eff values are non-nullish).
  - src/runner/run/prompt.resolve.plan.test.ts: drop unused mkdir import.
  - Purpose: reduce @typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition and unused-vars without changing behavior.

- Fix snap handler SSR capture resolver
  - Resolved TypeError in src/cli/snap.stash.success.test.ts where `captureSnapshotAndArchives` was not a function under Vitest SSR.
  - In src/runner/snap/snap-run.ts, resolve `captureSnapshotAndArchives` via a named‑or‑default dynamic import pattern: prefer the named export; fall back to `default.captureSnapshotAndArchives`; finally accept default export when callable.
  - Aligns with existing SSR‑robust patterns used across run/session and CLI snap handler.

- CLI robustness — patch + snap UX
  - src/cli/index.ts: accept default-as-function fallback for `registerPatch` to fix “registerPatch not found” under SSR/mocks.
  - src/cli/snap.ts: • Emit explicit confirmations “stash saved changes” and “stash pop restored changes” around the snap flow when `-s/--stash` is active, so tests can assert the behavior. • Pass a numeric index to `handleSet` to avoid string/number ambiguity in tests.

- SSR robustness — hoist snap registration
  - src/cli/snap.ts: convert `registerSnap` from a const arrow to a function declaration to avoid “registerSnap is not a function” under Vitest SSR/mocks (TDZ/cycle hazards).
  - Aligns with prior hoists (deriveRunParameters, color helpers).

- Run action SSR fallback (engine config)
  - Resolve `resolveEngineConfigLazy` at action time with a named‑or‑default picker (callable default fallback) to fix “not a function” under SSR/mocks.
  - File: `src/cli/run/action/index.ts`.

- Snap CLI safety (root/sub)
  - Apply parse normalization and exit override unconditionally on root and sub after best‑effort resolution to prevent “unknown command 'node'”.

- Decompose CLI snap module (src/cli/snap.ts) into small, testable units
  - Created src/cli/snap/: index.ts (registry), safety.ts (idempotent exit/argv guards), handlers.ts (lazy SSR‑robust resolvers), options.ts (stash flags default tagging), action.ts (header/loop guard, stash flow, capture).
  - Preserved SSR safety patterns and concise stash confirmations; retained raw string semantics for “set <index>”.
  - Import stability: “./snap” now targets the folder barrel (index.ts); no call site changes required.

- Tests — stabilize deriveRunInvocation import shape under SSR (runner.combine)
  - src/cli/run-args.ts: keep the named export and add a default export object that exposes deriveRunInvocation for SSR/default-shaped imports.
  - Fixes “deriveRunInvocation is not a function” in CLI combine tests under Vitest SSR.

- Diff archive — do not pass anchors to DIFF
  - src/runner/run/session/archive-stage.ts: pass anchors only to FULL; DIFF uses a config without anchors.
  - Prevents anchored files such as `.stan/system/facet.state.json` from appearing in `archive.diff.tar` unless they actually changed.
  - Keeps FULL archives inclusive per overlay/anchors policy while preserving “changed-only” semantics for DIFF.

- Tests — stabilize loaders resolution under SSR (runner.defaults)
  - src/cli/run/action/loaders.ts: add a default export object exposing named helpers (resolveEngineConfigLazy, loadCliConfigSyncLazy, loadDeriveRunParameters) so default-shaped imports work.
  - Fixes “resolveEngineConfigLazy not found” in run defaults tests.

- Lint — src/cli/index.ts cleanup
  - Remove unused catch parameter in SSR/mocks fallback for registerPatch resolution to satisfy @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars.
  - No behavior change; keep SSR resilience intact.

- Facets — enable “snap” for next run to edit src/runner/snap/history.ts; defer code patch to next turn per guard.
- CLI runner tests — hoist deriveRunInvocation to a function declaration (fix SSR import shape) and keep default export; tests in cli/runner.combine.test.ts should pass.
- Patch CLI lint — typed local argv normalizer in src/cli/patch.ts to eliminate unsafe-return any[] without changing behavior.

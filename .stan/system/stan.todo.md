# STAN Development Plan

Note: Aggressively enable/disable facets to keep visibility on current work while minimizing archive size. Resolve as many issues per turn as possible. No nibbles — take big bites.

## Next up (priority order)

- Implement `-w/--workspace` support:
  - Add `fast-glob` to dependencies.
  - Create `src/cli/root/workspace.ts` (resolution logic for pnpm/npm workspaces).
  - Update `src/cli/index.ts` to register the global option and pre-hook.
- Consider release prep for the breaking facet flag change (changelog/versioning) once you’re satisfied with the docs and test coverage.

## Completed (context essentials only)

**CRITICAL: Append-only list. Add new completed items at the end. Prune old completed entries from the top. Do not edit existing entries.**

- Make repo ESM-only: update rollup config (drop CJS) and package.json exports.
- Verified ESM-only build/exports and full CI suite (build/docs/knip/test/lint/typecheck passed).
- Refactored documentation to enforce the "Run -> Snap -> Patch" loop model, emphasizing "Run" as the save point and "Patch" as the intelligence center.
